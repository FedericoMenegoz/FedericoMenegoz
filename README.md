# Class projects:
## Spottythings 🔎
Project link: https://github.com/IS22-TEAM-25

This is my first ever class group project we went through the different phases of software engineering:
- Planning of the project
- Requirement Analysis
- Designing the interface 
- Implementing the web application
- Testing the web application
- Deployment

The final result (implementation wise) is probably a bit messy as we didn't really know any of the technology we used at the time, but it was fun and it was a great opportunity to learn and work with others.

## Tum4world 🌍
Project link: https://github.com/Team19-WebP

This was a project for the Introduction of Web development class, the assignment was to develop a simple web app for an association.

<p>I am currently studying hard to finish the bachelor course in computer science, but I am looking forward to contributing to the open source community. I'm eager to roll up my sleeves and get my hands greasy, so I really hope to start putting new projects here very soon!</p>
